## Description
I was tasked with creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## About
I built this recat application using bootstrap for the inital template to help me get a good structure for what I wanted. I made sure to include the App.jsx, Header, Projects, Skills section and Contact form on the page. 

I have 2 examples of my work in the project section for people to go and view and links to my CV, Linkedin and to Email me. I chose to leave the option of a phone number off of the page. 

React is something I am still getting to grips with so I am proud of myself for being able to get the site functioning and live. 

I used Netlify to publish my application/portfolio live.
